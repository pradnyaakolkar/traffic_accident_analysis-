# Indian Traffic Accident Data Analytics (2022â€“2025)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes Indian traffic accident data from 2022â€“2025 to uncover trends, contributing factors, and predictive insights. 
The goal is to improve road safety awareness and provide actionable insights via interactive dashboards.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw traffic accident datasets.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends.
- Build interactive Power BI dashboards for visualization.
- Optionally apply machine learning models for accident severity prediction.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                # Raw and cleaned CSV files
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/           # Jupyter notebooks for analysis
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ traffic_analysis.ipynb
â”œâ”€â”€ dashboards/          # Power BI (.pbix) files
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md            # Project overview (this file)
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
```

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn - optional)
- **Power BI** for dashboards
- **GitHub** for version control and showcasing work

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard Layout (Suggested)
1. **Overview Page**: KPIs (Total Accidents, Fatalities, Year-over-Year trends).
2. **State-wise Map**: Interactive map with filters (Year, Vehicle Type).
3. **Contributing Factors**: Charts showing causes (speeding, weather, etc.).
4. **Predictive Insights**: Comparison of predicted vs. actual severity (optional).

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic_accident_analysis.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/traffic_analysis.ipynb
   ```
4. Clean and export the data, then open `traffic_accidents_cleaned.csv` in Power BI.

## ðŸŒŸ Highlights for LinkedIn
- Post snapshots of your Power BI dashboard with key insights.
- Tag relevant hashtags like #DataAnalytics, #PowerBI, #IndianRoadSafety.
- Include the GitHub repository link in your LinkedIn **Featured** section.
